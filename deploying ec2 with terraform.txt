#terraform init
create directory
#mkdir demo1
#cd demo1
create a terraform config file
#vim main.tf 

provider section defines where we are deploying resources 
resource section defines property of resource that we are deploying

provider "aws" {
access_key = ""
secret_key = ""
region = ""
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
ami = ""
instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

#terraform validate
#terraform fmt - format the files
